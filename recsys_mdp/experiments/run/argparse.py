# [1]: Using sweeps we have a problem with config logging. All parameters provided to
# a run from the sweep via run args are logged to wandb automatically. At the same time,
# when we also log our compiled config dictionary, its content is flattened such that
# each param key is represented as `path.to.nested.dict.key`. Note that we declare
# params in a sweep config the same way. Therefore, each sweep run will have such params
# visibly duplicated in wandb and there's no correct way to distinguish them
# (although, wandb itself does it)! Also, only sweep runs will have params duplicated.
# Simple runs don't have the duplicate entry because they don't have sweep param args.
#
# Problem: when you want to filter or group by a param in wandb interface,
# you cannot be sure which of the duplicated entries to select, while they're different
# â€” the only entry that is presented in all runs [either sweep or simple] is the entry
# from our config, not from a sweep.
#
# Solution: That's why we introduced a trick - you are allowed to specify sweep param
# with insignificant additional dots (e.g. `path..to...key.`) to de-duplicate entries.
# We ignore these dots [or empty path elements introduced by them after split-by-dots]
# while parsing the nested key path.
